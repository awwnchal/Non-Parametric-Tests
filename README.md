# Non-Parametric-Tests

Non-parametric tests, also known as distribution-free tests, are a family of statistical methods used to test hypotheses when there is no assumption about the underlying distribution of the population. These tests are useful when the assumptions of normality, equal variances, or linearity are not met. Non-parametric tests do not rely on the numerical values of the observations, but rather on their ranks or orderings.

Types of Non-parametric Tests

Here are some commonly used non-parametric tests:

Mann-Whitney U Test: Used to compare two independent groups.
Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test: Used to compare two related or paired samples.

Kruskal-Wallis H Test: Used to compare more than two independent groups.

Friedman Test: Used to compare more than two related or paired samples.

Sign Test: Used to test for the median of a population.

Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages:

Do not require assumptions of normality, equal variances, or linearity.
Suitable for small sample sizes.
More robust to outliers.

Disadvantages:

Less powerful than parametric tests when assumptions are met.
May require larger sample sizes to achieve the same power as parametric tests.
May not be as well-known or commonly used as parametric tests.
